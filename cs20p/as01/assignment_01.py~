CS20P: Assigment_01 - Computing GC Content

Given: At most 10 DNA strings in FASTA format (of length at most 1 kbp each).
Return: The ID of the string having the highest GC-content, followed by the
GC-content of that string. Rosalind allows for a default error of 0.001 in
all decimal answers unless otherwise stated;
